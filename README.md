# ðŸ«‚ Role-Based-Data-Management
The Role-Based Data Management project is designed to implement a secure, scalable, and efficient system for managing user access and dynamically filtering database information based on user roles and permissions. By employing role-based access control (RBAC), this project ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals, promoting compliance with data governance standards and enhancing organizational security.

Beyond its security focus, the project integrates analytical capabilities to enable actionable insights while maintaining robust access controls. The system is suitable for businesses requiring stringent data privacy policies while seeking to empower decision-making through data-driven strategies.
