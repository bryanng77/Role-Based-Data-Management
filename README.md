# 🫂 Role-Based-Data-Management

## Project Background
The People Analytics team initiated the Role-Based Data Management project to tackle challenges in securely managing employee data and providing tailored access to sensitive information. This project was critical as a manager accidentally accessed payroll data for another department due to a lack of proper access controls. This incident breached privacy and risked non-compliance with data protection laws, highlighting the urgent need for a more secure and role-sensitive data management system.

## The Solution: Role-Based Access Control
The HR Analytics team initiated the Role-Based Data Management Project to address these challenges. This ensures that users only see relevant and authorized data for their role.

For example:

1️⃣ A Manager can view employee performance data and trends only for their department.

2️⃣ An HR Administrator (in this case, the People Analytics Team), can access organization-wide data but must adhere to strict logging and monitoring protocols.

3️⃣ An Employee has access only to their personal information, shielding them from unnecessary exposure to broader datasets.


## Objectives

+ Enhance the security of employee data by implementing role-based access controls.

+ Provide granular access tailored to specific roles, ensuring users only access information relevant to their responsibilities.

+ Reduce risks of data breaches and compliance violations.

+ Enable data-driven decision-making by organizing and analyzing workforce data efficiently.
